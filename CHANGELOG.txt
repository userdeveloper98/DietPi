v6.20
(xx/12/18)

Image lineup:
- We removed Jessie images from our download server (besides for Odroid C1), since we see no advantage to use them anymore. Existing Jessie systems are still supported, but we encourage all users to consider switching to a fresh Stretch image by times.

Changes / Improvements / Optimisations:
- DietPi-PREP | Removed the option to install a Jessie system. Removed the option to install DietPi on top of a Wheezy image, since an upgrade over two distro version would be required, which is not reliable. It is still possible to install DietPi on top of a Jessie image, where a distro upgrade to Stretch would be applied: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/2332
- DietPi-Config | RPi: Improved available options for HDMI boost setting: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/2350
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Now allows to check & repair the boot file system and trigger it for root file system on next reboot: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/1740#issuecomment-388325204
- DietPi-Software | Blynk: Reinstalls now preserve existing config files; New directory structure and blynk user (v6.19) is patched now as well to existing installs: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/pull/2324
- DietPi-Software | Plex Media Server: Updated to v1.14.0 on x86 images, switch to HTTPS ARM repo and automated locale switch to en_US.UTF-8: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/2294
- DietPi-Software | Nextcloud Talk: Disable the very verbose coturn logging by default to reduce disk I/O. This can be overridden via /etc/turnserver.conf: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/2321
- DietPi-Software | Deluge: UMask 002 applied to all downloads: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/2339

Bug Fixes:
- DietPi-Software | ownCloud/Nextcloud (Talk): Resolved an issue, where occ/ncc commands could fail, if Redis server is not running: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/2321
- General | AudioPhonics I-Sabre-K2M: Once the driver is compiled, it will no longer be recompiled. This prevents ALSA installs from re-compiling the driver each time.

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+base%3Amaster

v6.15
(12/09/18)

Many thanks to PINE64, for becoming our 1st Patreon Legend and supporting our project! As one of their rewards, you will see PINE64 displayed on login via the DietPi-Banner.

Known issues / In progress:
DietPi-Software | Open Bazaar: Installation updated to server version 2, which now runs via go language. At the current state, client OB connections are failing, still under investigation: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/1090#issuecomment-419613346

Changes / Improvements / Optimizations:
General | Changed Survey and Bugreport uploads to use ssh.dietpi.com (previously IP): https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/2022#issuecomment-415470064
General | 1st run setup and dietpi-update logs are now created in RAM, then copied to disk once completed '/var/tmp/dietpi/logs/dietpi-firstrun-setup.log'. This will speed up 1st run setup installation for slow SBCs and/or rootFS.
General | PineA64: Image updated to v6.14, also contains the latest kernel/uboot by Ayufan (0.6.2): https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/2026
General | Resolved an isssue where the initial 1st run connection test would fail, if timesync had not yet completed, and, the SSL cert of the connection test site is not valid for current date on system: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/2039
General| SparkySBC: Support for native DSD playback on iFi Pro iDSD. Many thanks @sudeep: https://github.com/sparky-sbc/sparky-test/tree/master/dsd-marantz
DietPi-Backup/Sync | rsync transfer: Now shows progress information during the transfer: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/2044#issuecomment-417779406
DietPi-Backup | Added an option to delete the currently selected backup, if it exists.
DietPi-Config | Advanced Options: You can now toggle if a real RTC is installed. This adds/removes 'fake-hwclock' package installation as requested: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/2041
DietPi-Config | Added support for setting CPU min/max frequencies on Intel based CPUs. NB: 'cpu' command will always list the min/max frequencies read from kernel values, Intel CPUs do not update these values, however, you can gauge CPU frequency range by running 'cpu' to monitor the current CPU freq (use of stress test in 'dietpi-config' may also help).
DietPi-Drive_Manager | Added support to set a global idle duration, before drives are powered down. This feature uses hdparm.

DietPi-Software | A new unified download&install function is implemented, which allows more consistent download and install of software, using /tmp RAMFS as working directory and parallel dependencies installation via G_THREAD.
DietPi-Software | Koel: Installation will now skip webserver, as Koel uses PHP-CLI instead. To not mess with webserver served pages, Koel install directory is moved to "/mnt/dietpi_userdata/koel", for existing installs as well.
DietPi-Software | Mono: Now installs 'mono-complete' by default, required for Mono based applications (eg: Radarr/Sonarr/Lidarr/Jackett etc)
DietPi-Software | Lidarr: Now available for installation, automatically download music: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/1874
DietPi-Software | Samba Server: Now creates and defaults to the login creds for the 'dietpi' user (previously 'root'). For fresh installations of Samba only: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/1991#issuecomment-410505982

Folding@home is a distributed computing project for disease research that simulates protein folding, computational drug design, and other types of molecular dynamics. As of today, the project is using the idle resources of personal computers owned by volunteers from all over the world. Thousands of people contribute to the success of this project. Thanks to @nnovaes for bringing this to our attention!
DietPi-Software | XFCE: Added support for shutdown, restart, hibernate and suspend directly from XFCE panel by default. Existing installs will not be touched, but if required simply run: "apt-get -y install upower policykit-1"
DietPi-Software | Pi-hole: Installation code updated to support the latest release (v4). If you want to upgrade your existing installation, we highly recommend existing users who have this installed to: Uninstall Pi-hole via "dietpi-software", once completed, install Pi-hole again via "dietpi-software": https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/1696
DietPi-Drive_Manager | Added NFSv3 mount support. Drive manager now detects NFSv3-only server and offers to enter the required server-side path to the shared folder: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/1940
DietPi-Drive_Manager | Now installs "ntfs-3g" and "hfsplus" on demand, if those file systems are detected. This allows us to ship images without "ntfs-3g" and "hfsplus" preinstalled, which are not required by most users. Those packages will be removed on v6.13 patch as well, if the related file systems are not detected.
DietPi-LetsEncrypt | Added information/warning about HTTPS and HSTS according to web applications with standalone webserver: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/1908
DietPi-Cron | /etc/cron.minutely/ is now disabled by default, to reduce cron executions and logs. This is also patched with v6.13, if no script is placed within the folder. Use "dietpi-cron" to enable and configure this feature.
General | All DietPi scripts by default now use /tmp RAMFS to create, download and handle temporary files. By this we speed up especially installations and reduce disk I/O: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/1801
General | By default systemd-logind is now masked on DietPi images. This can be changed by setting AUTO_UNMASK_LOGIND=1 within dietpi.txt. As well it will be unmasked automatically, if libpam-systemd was installed during dietpi-software installation: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/1767
General | "fake-hwclock" is purged now on first run setup and v6.13 patch, if a real hardware clock is available.
Image | NanoPC-T4: Image updated which now includes custom kernel/modules created by @carlosedp. Adds CIFS, docker support and much more. Please note, WiFi scan is intermittent with this kernel, and, may take a few attempts to be successful, however, we believe the additional modules are a higher priority: https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/1829
Image | RPi: New RPi images will be shipped without "initramfs-tools" preinstalled. The RPi bootloader does no require it and there are alternatives, e.g. "rpi-initramfs-tools" and "tiny-initramfs". The package can be manually purged on RPi systems, but "kmod" and "udev" need to be marked als manually installed first, so they will never be removed: "apt-mark manual kmod udev && apt-mark auto initramfs-tools && G_AGA"

Bug Fixes:
